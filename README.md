Binary-Tree-Traversal-and-Manipulation

This project focuses on implementing and manipulating a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C#. It includes core functionalities such as node insertion, tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and height calculation. The project allows users to interact with the tree via a console-based interface, providing a hands-on understanding of how binary trees work. The main goals are to demonstrate efficient data organization, retrieval, and understanding of recursion through tree traversal methods.
