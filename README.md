# Binary-Tree-Traversal-and-Manipulation

This project focuses on implementing and manipulating a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C#. It includes core functionalities such as node insertion, tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order), and height calculation. The project allows users to interact with the tree via a console-based interface, providing a hands-on understanding of how binary trees work. The main goals are to demonstrate efficient data organization, retrieval, and understanding of recursion through tree traversal methods.

## Instructions:

### Insert Words into the Tree:

Input words to add them to the binary search tree.

### Tree Traversal:

Select in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal to display the tree.

### Check Tree Height:

Display the height of the tree.

### Example:

Insert words: 
"apple", "banana", "cherry".
Perform in-order traversal.

### Expected output: 

"apple, banana, cherry".
