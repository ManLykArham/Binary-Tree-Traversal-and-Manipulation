# 🌳 Binary-Tree-Traversal-and-Manipulation

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

In this project, I implemented a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using C#. The project includes key functionalities like **node insertion**, various **tree traversal methods** (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and **height calculation**. Users can interact with the tree through a console-based interface, making it easy to see how the binary tree works behind the scenes. 🎮

### 🎯 Achievements

This project gave me the opportunity to dive deep into **recursion** and the workings of **binary trees**—fundamental concepts in computer science. By implementing tree traversal algorithms and optimising tree operations, I sharpened my understanding of how to efficiently **organise** and **retrieve data**. This project particularly enhanced my skills in solving complex problems using structured approaches like **recursive functions**. 🔄

### ✨ Overall

Working on this Binary Search Tree was a milestone in translating abstract theoretical concepts into real-world applications. I gained insight into how binary trees lay the groundwork for many important algorithms, and how **recursion** simplifies otherwise complex operations. This project not only helped me improve my **algorithm design** skills, but also allowed me to understand the broader implications of **data structure management** in software development. 💻

## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **🌱 Insert Words into the Tree:**  
   Input words to add them to the binary search tree.

2. **🔍 Tree Traversal:**  
   Choose between in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal to display the tree’s elements.

3. **📏 Check Tree Height:**  
   Get the height of the tree based on its structure.

### 📊 Example

**Insert words:**  
`"apple", "banana", "cherry"`  

**Perform in-order traversal:**  
`Expected Output: "apple, banana, cherry"`
